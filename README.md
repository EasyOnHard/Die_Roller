# Die Roller
This project is inspired by abe's projects' (Die Roller)[https://youtu.be/7Y_vFvCPHmE?si=EHspXUTLmduVLmGT].

The goal of this project is to have a nifty little gadget to roll dice and display them on a SSD1306 OLED display.

I am using the Seeed Xiao RP2040 as the brains of the operation and a button/EC11 as inputs.
